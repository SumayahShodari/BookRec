It comprises a series of episodes in a dozen generations of a family from the Egyptian urban rabble (the "harafish").

Neither the location within Egypt nor the time of the events is ever identified.</p>

            <p>&nbsp &nbsp Naguib Mahfouz wrote the novel differently from the official novels, as the novel is not divided into chapters, but is divided alphabetically by the names of the three volumes (Al-Marakibi, Al-Masry, and Al-Kleiope), where Naguib Mahfouz depicted a period in the life of the Egyptian people in terms of their customs, traditions, and history.</p>
