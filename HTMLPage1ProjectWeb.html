               <h2> Before the Coffee Gets Cold </h2>
               <p> The book tells about a café in Tokyo that allows its customers to travel back in time, 
               as long as they return before their coffee gets cold. 
               The story originally began as a play in 2010, 
               before being adapted into a novel in 2015. 
               It was translated into English by Geoffrey Trousselot and published 
               by Picador in September 2019. The idea behind the story is a beautifully simple premise;
               a gateway to time travel in an unassuming cafe. 
               But there are as many curious and magical details 
               to the time travel itself as there are characters to meet.</p><br><br>

               <h2> Surrounded by Psychopaths </h2>
               <p> Using the same simple four-color system of behavior classification that made Surrounded by Idiots so popular,
               Surrounded by Psychopaths teaches readers how to deal with psychopaths 
               in their lives by becoming aware of their own behavior and their weaknesses.
               The book claimed that by learning more about your personality type and how you work, 
               you’ll be able to see through any psychopath’s manipulative behaviours 
               and fend off their attempts to wreak havoc into your life.</p><br><br>

               <h2> Man's Search for Meaning</h2>
               <p> Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers 
               with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. 
               Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, 
               Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, 
               find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. At the heart of his theory, 
               known as logotherapy, is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure 
               but the pursuit of what we find meaningful. Man's Search for Meaning has become one 
               of the most influential books in America; it continues to inspire us all to 
               find significance in the very act of living. </p>
